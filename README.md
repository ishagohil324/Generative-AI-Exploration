# Generative-AI-Exploration

What is Generative AI?
-->Generative AI refers to models that can generate new data — text, images, audio, code, or even video — that looks like it was created by humans.

Popular examples include:

ChatGPT – generates human-like text

DALL·E / Stable Diffusion – creates images

Suno / Udio – composes music

 Claude / Gemini – conversational AI

These systems are powered by deep learning architectures like Transformers and Diffusion Models.

Generative AI is transforming industries — from marketing and education to art, software, and film — and this project documents my daily journey of mastering it.
